<h3>My mother reads poetry</h3>
<h4>Georgi Gospodinov</h4>
<h5>(translated from Bulgarian by Maria Vassileva)</h5>

<p>2 packs thin ready-rolled pastry sheets <br>
2 coffee cups butter melted <br>
a kilogram of apples <br>
1 cup biscuit crumbs <br>
1 cup ground walnuts <br>
2 coffee cups sugar <br>
1 packet cinnamon powder</p>

<p>Wash the apples, peel <br>
and remove the seeds, grate <br>
in large strips, mix <br>
with the sugar, the ground walnuts <br>
and the cinnamon. <br>
Take a pastry sheet, <br>
grease it <br>
and cover it with another sheet. <br>
Spread some of the apple mix <br>
over them and roll <br>
them together. Repeat <br>
with the other pastry sheets. <br>
Grease them and bake <br>
over medium heat, until <br>
the top crust is red, <br>
and the bottom pink. </p>

<p>When you bake it, it’s a strudel, <br>
but for now it’s still a poem. </p>
